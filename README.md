# Excel Automation Add-in

This project is an Excel automation add-in that integrates VBA with a Python backend. It enables context-aware Excel cell operations like entering formulas or navigating to specific cells, based on the spreadsheet's data and layout. The add-in is designed to enhance productivity and reduce manual work by generating Excel instructions through an AI model.

## Demos (My hands are off the keyboard!)

### 1. It can fill by intelligently understanding the worksheet

`Fill this column appropriately starting from D2 till D5`

### 2. It is super useful for formula based tasks

`Fill this cell with the correct formula/value`

### 3. Or filling entire tables!

`Fill this table completely using 4 NBA teams in this column`

## Features

- Contextual AI-driven Excel commands
- Lightweight communication via flag-based signaling

## Architecture

1. **VBA (Frontend)**:
   - Triggers Python script via `WScript.Shell` and `forms` for loading screen.

2. **Python (Backend)**:
   - Reads current Excel state and executes user's automation tasks.

## Polling, polling, polling...

Due to VBAâ€™s lack of an intuitive async or callback support:

- **Race conditions**: `xlwings` could not access Excel during `Application.Wait`.
- **No native callbacks**: VBA required a workaround for communication.
- **Polling with flags**: To coordinate Python-VBA interaction, simple file-based flags were used to indicate stages like "loading started" and "done".

This workaround ensured non-blocking communication across two runtimes.

## Potential Improvements

- Add more error handling in both VBA and Python
- Replace file-based flags
- Enhance UI/UX with progress bars
- Support for undo actions, multiple sheets, or more command types
